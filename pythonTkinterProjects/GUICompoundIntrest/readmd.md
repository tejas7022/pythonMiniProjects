Compound Interest formula: 
 

Formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 
Amount= P(1 + R/100)t

Compound Interest = Amount â€“ P
Where, 
P is principle amount 
R is the rate and 
T is the time span

Pseudo Code: 
 

Input principle amount. Store it in some variable say principle.
Input time in some variable say time.
Input rate in some variable say rate.
Calculate Amount using formula, 
Amount = principle * (1 + rate / 100)  time).
Calculate Compound Interest using Formula.
Finally, print the resultant value of CI.
Example: 
 

Input : Principle (amount): 1200
        Time: 2
        Rate: 5.4
Output : Compound Interest = 133.099243
